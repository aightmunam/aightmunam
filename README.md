# Hi, I'm Munam. 
##### I'm 21 and yet I feel very old. ðŸ‘‹


- Iâ€™m currently working as a *Software Engineer* @[Arbisoft](https://arbisoft.com/)
- Nowadays, I work on *Django*. I love working with *Python* :bomb:
- Currently, I am learning [Golang](https://tour.golang.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and [System Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/01344941640).
- I loveeeee rock music to the point where my youtube recommendations are littered with *Tool, Led Zeppelin, Pantera, Pink Floyd, SlipKnot* and *Gojira*. 
- In my free time, I like to spend time reading DL research papers. That is, when I get some time from reading a shitload of fantasy novels. Currently, I'm re-reading *Joe Abercrombie*'s 5th book in the First Law world, [*The Heroes*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9300768-the-heroes) :book:
