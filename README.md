### Hi human. Or bot? I'm Munam, a 21 year young man that feels very old  👋


- I’m currently working as a Software Engineer @[Arbisoft][https://arbisoft.com/]
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that sounds fun. :boom:
- Nowadays, I work on *Django* and *React*. I love working with Python but I don't JS at all :-1:
- I loveeeee rock music to the point where my youtube recommendations are littered with *Tool, Led Zeppelin, Pantera, Pink Floyd, SlipKnot* and *Gojira*. See that diversity? I make no judgement with the kind of music one listens, as long as it's Rock and not some sissy Pop music. Jk jk, listen whatever you feel like. But Rock music tho? Insaneee. :metal:
- On my free time, I like to spend time reading DL research papers. That is, when I get some time from reading a shitload of fantasy novels. Currently, I'm re-reading first three Stormlight Archives novel before I read the 4th, *Rhythm of War* :book:
