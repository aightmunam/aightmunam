# Hi, I'm Munam. 
##### I'm 22 and yet I feel very old. ðŸ‘‹


- Iâ€™m currently working as a *Backend Engineer*
- Nowadays, I work on *Python*, *Django* and *DRF*. :bomb:
- Currently, I am learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [System Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/01344941640) ðŸ“˜
- I love rock music to the point where my spotify recommendations are littered with *Tool, Led Zeppelin, Pantera, Pink Floyd, SlipKnot* and *Gojira*. 
- In my free time, I like to spend time reading DL research papers. That is, when I get some time from reading a whole lot of fantasy novels. Currently, I'm reading *Mark Lawrence*'s, [*Book of the Ancestor series*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/185644-book-of-the-ancestor) :book:
