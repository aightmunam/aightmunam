### Hi human. Or bot? I'm Munam. I'm 21 and yet I feel very old  ðŸ‘‹


- Iâ€™m currently working as a *Software Engineer* @[Arbisoft](https://arbisoft.com/)
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that sounds fun. :boom:
- Nowadays, I work on *Django* and *React*. I love working with *Python* :bomb:
- Currently, I am learning [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.5/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [Golang](https://tour.golang.org/), and [System Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/01344941640).
- I loveeeee rock music to the point where my youtube recommendations are littered with *Tool, Led Zeppelin, Pantera, Pink Floyd, SlipKnot* and *Gojira*. See that diversity? I make no judgement with the kind of music one listens to, as long as it's *Rock* and not some sissy *Pop* music. Jk jk, listen whatever you feel like. But Rock music tho? Insaneee. :metal:
- On my free time, I like to spend time reading DL research papers. That is, when I get some time from reading a shitload of fantasy novels. Currently, I'm re-reading *Joe Abercrombie*'s 5th book in the First Law world, [*The Heroes*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9300768-the-heroes) :book:
