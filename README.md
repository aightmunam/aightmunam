# Hi, I'm Munam. 

- I‚Äôm currently working as a *Backend Engineer* (working on *Python*, *Django*, *AWS*)
- My favorite part of software engineering is learning and re-learning scalability. I really enjoy (after a fair bit of frustration at figuring things out üòÖ) optimizing a system for maximum performance, figuring out acceptable tradeoffs by doing tradeoff analysis, and applying novel solutions to my own problems.
- Some holy grail books (imo):
    1. [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321)
    2. [System Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/01344941640)
    3. [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
    4. [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008) üêç
